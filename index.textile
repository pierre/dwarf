<h1 id="Overview">Overview</h1>

Dwarf is a collection of Open-Source libraries, utilities and servers to build large-scale Analytics infrastructures.

<h2 id="Serialization">Serialization</h2>

The serialization library has the building blocks of the Dwarf framework. See "Serialization overview":serialization/overview.html for more information on its content.

<h2 id="Collector">Collector</h2>
The Collector is an HDFS endpoint collecting and aggregating data flows. Clients post events to the server which in turn writes them into HDFS. Among API supported: HTTP (url based), "Thrift":http://thrift.apache.org/ and "Smile":http://jackson.codehaus.org/ payloads.

It provides additional services including data validation as well as bucketizing to limit the number of files the Hadoop Namenode needs to track.

See "Collector architecture":collector/architecture.html for more information on its design.

<h2 id="HFind">HFind</h2>

HFind is a find implementation for Hadoop. It follows as close as possible the "POSIX specification":http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/find.html, meaning that you can use it on your cluster, just like you would use find:

<pre>
    [pierre@mouraf ~]$ hfind /user/pierre -type f -name "file*.dat" -o -type d -name a
    /pierre/testing/a
    /pierre/testing/a/b/fileb.dat

    [pierre@mouraf ~]$ hfind /user/pierre -mtime +3 -type d
    /user/pierre/2010/09
    /user/pierre/2010/09/20
    /user/pierre/2010/09/21
</pre>

<h2 id="Sweeper">Sweeper</h2>

When monitoring a Hadoop cluster, two numbers come in mind: disk usage and how many files are tracked by the namenode. Sweeper is a small Java-based utility tool, that lets you quickly find large directories to clean up or small files to combine.

Sweeper displays by default individual file sizes:

It can also be configured to display the number of files per directories:
