h2(#Sweeper). Sweeper

Sweeper displays by default individual file sizes:

!resources/sweeper_files_counts.png!

It can also be configured to display the number of files per directories:

The latter is useful whenever one needs to reduce the number of files the namenode has to manage. It helps finding files that should be combined into larger ones.
